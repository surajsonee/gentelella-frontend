Description: 
        Tabular data as published on the web is often not well formatted
        and structured. Messytables tries to detect and fix errors in the
        data. Typical examples include:
        
        * Finding the header of a table when there are explanations and
          text fragments in the first few rows of the table.
        * Guessing the type of columns in CSV data.
        
        This library provides data structures and some heuristics to
        fix these problems and read a wide number of different tabular
        abominations.
